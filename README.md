# Hate speech projects

This is the result of two interdisciplinary projects of [Social Network Analysis course](https://elearning.unipd.it/scienzeumane/course/view.php?id=9257), held at the University of Padova by Tommaso Erseghe and Caterina Suitner.

The analysis are based on the database collected and coded by Amnesty International - Italy for the research ["Il Barometro dell'odio - elezioni europee 2019"](https://www.amnesty.it/cosa-facciamo/elezioni-europee/) and Salvatore Romano for his [master thesis](https://github.com/SalvatoreRomano1/thesis) "Haters gonna (make you) hate: il Negative Campaign come predittore dellâ€™hate speech online nelle elezioni europee del 2019 in Italia."

The full database is not avaible to public, you can request to use it for research propose to Amnesty International.
This project will rely on a [drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zwXprmJgb6MEf1bFNjTDd_gHFF-fVIRE?usp=sharing) with the not public files, only avaible to the email accounts of the members of the groups.
