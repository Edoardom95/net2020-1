# Hate speech projects

This is the result of two interdisciplinary projects of [Social Network Analysis course](https://elearning.unipd.it/scienzeumane/course/view.php?id=9257), held at the University of Padova by Tommaso Erseghe and Caterina Suitner.

The analysis are based on the database collected and coded by Amnesty International - Italy for the research ["Il Barometro dell'odio - elezioni europee 2019"](https://www.amnesty.it/cosa-facciamo/elezioni-europee/) and Salvatore Romano for his [master thesis](https://github.com/SalvatoreRomano1/thesis) "Haters gonna (make you) hate: il Negative Campaign come predittore dellâ€™hate speech online nelle elezioni europee del 2019 in Italia."
