# First week - common start - play with data
### This is the folder with the data and scripts for the first week of the group project.

The idea of this first week is to take confidence with the data.
You can try to import the .csv file and make some general graphs to be sure you understood as much as possible the main variables involved.
You can use our telegram chat as a forum to report issues about the DB.

```common_start.py``` is the same script as ```common_start.ipynb```, the second one is in Jupiter Notebook format.

The file contains some information about the database.
I also made two general graphs that will show you two main results of my master thesis. 
Take them as examples of what you could do for a generical description of the DB.

### You can try the script
To use the script you should:
- clone the directory ```git clone git@github.com:SalvatoreRomano1/net2020.git```
- download the ["databese" folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q6U4JlQadPKRWbAAeXQsRTcVX4PSlG0b?usp=sharing) from the shared G.drive 
- copy it to net2020/common_start/
- change the path of the DB in the script
- run the script
